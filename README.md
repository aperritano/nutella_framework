Nutella is a framework to build and run "Internet of Things"-like learning applications. It's still _very_ under development so keep an eye on new versions and help fix the bugs you find by [submitting issues](https://waffle.io/nutella-framework/nutella_framework). Nutella's goal is to be for the "Internet of Things" what Ruby on Rails has been for web applications. Ambitious? You bet, but where is the fun if the challenge is trivial?

gem install nutella_framework

All communications among these components are routed through an _MQTT broker_ which needs to be installed (together with its dependencies) before nutella can actually work correctly. Therefore **right after your install nutella** you should run: 
```
nutella checkup
```
in order to make sure all the dependencies have been correctly installed.

# Building & contributing
Clone the repo, `bundle install` to take care of the dependencies and then `rake` to run all the tests. If you want to perform some fancier task simply type `rake -T` for a list of awesomeness.
